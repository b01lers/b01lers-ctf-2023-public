The goal here is simply to write a program in the VM that i) properly terminates and ii) accumulates a total 
mileage of 0x31337. You get only 8 rows, i.e., a board of 8x24 = 192 characters. This was intentionally chosen 
low, in order to coax people into coding a loop. One can design a loop that gets very close to the required 
mileage, and then get the rest of the mileage via a handful of suitable characters.

VM commands used in solver:

  flow directions:  v > ^ <
  terminator:       @
  conditionals:     |
  duplicate:        #
  subtract:         -       
  is_zero:          !
  map_get:          g     
  nonspecial chars: '0', 0xf8, '5' 

The counter is at the top of the stack, it is initialized to 0xf8 via reading the (0,1) cell 
in the map, then gradually decremented by one until 0. 

Of course, there are many other similar ways to get this done.
