# switcheroo

This is a chaotic weekend, if you go to ctf time, there are 10 ctf happening in the same weekend.
Good thing is that there is one ctf mentioned in the desciption: wolvesecctf.
Just go to their challenge website, and you will see that they also have a challenge called switcheroo.
Solve that equally easy challenge and submit the flag here :)
