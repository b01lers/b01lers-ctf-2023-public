The little seed awaited its day to shoot through the soil;
On the eve of a truly momentous undertaking!
It first stretched out its feeble stem to the sun,
Dreaming that it would someday grow to become...
The tree that nourishes all life!

For ten thousand days the little sprout first grew;
Nourished by the salt of the earth, it stretched toward the sky!
While the salt had scattered for a hundred days after,
The little sprout discovered that, by the light of the morn...
It had nevertheless strengthened into a hardy tree!

Soon after it even blossomed, providing fruit a'plenty for all life;
But shadows soon scared them away, shaking the tree to its core!
The humans, blinded by their ignorance,
Split the poor tree in two...
Half left to rot in obscurity, half added right to the pyre!

Oh, little seed, how you were hashed-then-burned with the ultimate aphorism:
For dust you are and to dust you shall return!
